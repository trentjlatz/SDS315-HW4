# Statistical Analysis of Trades, Health Violations, Jury Selection & More
### Overview
This project demonstrates the application of statistical analysis techniques in R, focusing on hypothesis testing, chi-square tests, and statistical modeling. The problems analyzed include trade flagging at Iron Bank, health inspection violations, jury selection bias, and identifying AI-generated text using letter frequency analysis. Through these examples, I apply various statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions from real-world data.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
Hypothesis testing and p-value calculations
Chi-square tests for distribution analysis
Data wrangling and manipulation with tidyverse
Statistical modeling and simulation techniques
Reproducible research with RMarkdown
### Problems Analyzed
Iron Bank Flagged Trades – Analyzing the rate of flagged trades and comparing it to a baseline rate of 2.4%.
Gourmet Bites Health Inspections – Testing if the violation rate of Gourmet Bites is higher than the citywide average of 3%.
Evaluating Jury Selection for Bias – Using a chi-square test to assess if jury selection matches the county's population distribution.
LLM Watermarking – Analyzing letter frequency distributions to identify AI-generated text using chi-square statistics.
